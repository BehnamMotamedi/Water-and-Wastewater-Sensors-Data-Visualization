EC Data Visualization Shiny App
This Shiny app enables interactive visualization of Electric Conductivity (EC) and environmental parameters in water and wastewater networks. Developed by Behnam Motamedi, a Doctoral Researcher at the University of Oulu, Finland.

Overview
The app utilizes R with Shiny, Plotly, and other libraries to visualize sensor data from an Excel file. Users can explore EC trends, groundwater levels, precipitation, and air temperature over a specified date range. The interface allows customization of graph parameters and provides summary statistics for informed analysis.

Features
Dynamic Graphs:

Graph 1 displays EC and Groundwater Level trends over time.
Graph 2 illustrates Precipitation and Air Temperature trends.
User Customization:

Select date range, adjust Y-axis ranges, and choose parameters for each graph.
Summary Statistics:

View key statistics for selected parameters in a summary table.
